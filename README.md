## 💡 Resources

Based on the [OWASP Secure Coding Practices](https://owasp.org/www-project-secure-coding-practices-quick-reference-guide/) and [OWASP Code Review Guide](https://owasp.org/www-project-code-review/).

# ✅ OWASP Secure Code Review Checklist

This checklist is designed to guide manual secure code reviews and is aligned with OWASP recommendations.

## 🔐 Authentication

- [ ] Are strong password policies enforced?
- [ ] Is MFA (Multi-Factor Authentication) supported?
- [ ] Are credentials stored securely (e.g., hashed & salted)?

## 🔒 Authorization

- [ ] Are role-based access controls implemented?
- [ ] Is sensitive functionality protected from unauthorized users?

## 🛡️ Input Validation

- [ ] Are all user inputs validated and sanitized?
- [ ] Are parameterized queries used to prevent SQL Injection?

## 🔍 Logging and Error Handling

- [ ] Are detailed error messages avoided in production?
- [ ] Is sensitive information excluded from logs?

## 🧪 Code Quality & Dependencies

- [ ] Are static code analysis tools used?
- [ ] Are third-party dependencies regularly updated and scanned?

> Adapt this list based on your development stack and security needs.
